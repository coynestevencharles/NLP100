# NLP100

This is a log of my efforts to complete [NLP 100](https://nlp100.github.io/en/), a collection of NLP-themed programming questions.

UPDATE: Partway through, I switched to the Japanese version of NLP 100, which can be seen in [this repository](https://github.com/cl-tohoku/100knock-crash-2023/tree/steven).
